# SeaLevelRise

Group Members: Angel Karafas, Hannah Blank, Haylee Gaddy, Keshav Shah

Sea levels have been rising, causing huge problems such as flooding, eroding, loss of habitat, and contamination (“Sea Level Rise: Causes and Consequences”). The rising levels are caused by factors such as climate change, ice melt, land sinkage, and thermal expansion. We focused on two case studies, New Orleans and San Francisco, that are geographically different in order to show how sea level rise affects areas differently. We looked into each of their current infrastructure, and collected data to model future sea level rise for the two areas. We also delved into ways coastal cities can prepare for the rising sea levels, and how city vulnerabilities can add to the complications.
